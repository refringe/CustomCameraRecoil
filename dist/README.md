I'm a big fan of doing one thing and doing it well. With that, I give you the CustomCameraRecoil mod. It allows you to change the camera recoil on guns, or remove it entirely.

Uncompress the contents of the download into the `./user/mods/` directory.  
Open the `CustomCameraRecoil/config/config.json` file to adjust camera recoil options.

Enjoy.
